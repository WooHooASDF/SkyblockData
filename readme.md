## Skyblock Data
This is a program for automatic hypixel skyblock data gathering. It will currently grab all of the bazaar data when the refesh time expires.

# How to use

Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.

Create a config.json file with the following parameters:
```js
{
  apiKey: '' // Your api key here
